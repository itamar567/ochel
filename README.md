# OCHEL
OCHEL is a Python program that imitates DragonFable fights and provides an easier and faster way to create boss fights strategies and calculations.

## Features
OCHEL currently supports all game mechanics except for trinkets, on-click specials, pet switching, and mana resistance.

## Classes
Currently implemented classes:

- Technomancer
- Chaosweaver

## Enemies
Currently implemented enemies:

- Dummy (100k HP)
- Oratath

## Gear
Currently, no trinkets/special weapons are supported, and the only supported pet is the kid dragon.
You can add your own gear (except trinkets/special weapons/pets) using the inventory after starting a match.
The gear you added will be saved, and you will be able to use it in future matches.

## Getting Started
OCHEL is currently in pre-alpha, and therefore I do not suggest using it for damage calculations at the current state.

### Installation
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

#### Cloning the repository
Click the green Code button above the file list, then click Download ZIP and unzip the downloaded file.

#### Configuring stats
Edit `player_values.py` and configure the variables.
I plan on adding a user-friendly way of configuring the program in the future.

#### Running the program
Double-click `main.py` to run the program.
